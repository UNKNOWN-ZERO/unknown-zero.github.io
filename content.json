So let’s make a security software running on Windows that notify us when unidentified programs access a file. The name means nothing. It’s just my favorite colour and my zodiac sign. Brief PlanOk, the project can be divided by 3 parts. A filesystem minifilter driver that detects the file IO and notify Windows application. The communication module that communicates with minifilter driver. A Windows application with UI. Filesystem Minifilter DriverAs we can see in its name, it’s kernel mode. It mean we must be careful about memory usage, algorithm, function calls and etc.. When we violate one of its rules, we may see BSOD(Blue Screen of Death). That’s why we have to fully understand what we use. I mean WE MUST READ MANUALS AND FOLLOW. The Windows Hardware Dev Center espeacily “Installable file system” chapter is what we need. Also we need Windows Driver Kit, and Visual Studio 2017 to develop and build a filesystem minifilter driver. The Features of FileSystem Minifilter Driver can be summarized as follow. Interfere File IO Operation. Communicate or Notify Information about Files and Processes. Process Protection. The Filesystem Minifilter Driver will be developed with C. Communication ModuleIt’s a simple module sets of communicating functions with filesystem minifilter driver. It will be developed with C++ as DLL to support feature to a Windows application. Windows applicationThis part is mostly about UI showing information to user. When filesystem minifilter driver notify us that untrusted file IO happens, our program must show information about process information and its target file information for us to determine whether we permit or deny its file IO. This is a main feature of our solution. Also, we provide additional features to ensure user’s data, such as locking folders with password, auto backup on designated folder and process network usage monitor. Furthermore, we could make a cloud server to share user’s experience data like white list and black list of process reputation. This part will be developed with C# and winform. OK!
